    <!--BACKGROUND IMAGE-->
    <!--Used to design more a page, if you want a whole page to have background image
    define using the style attribute or your CSS with background image set for the whole body
  Note: If the background image is small, it will repeat itself horizontally and vertically until 
  it fits the size of the page, hence to prevent this repeat, define a CSS that says background-repeat
  and set its value to no repeat.
  
  If you want the background image to cover the whole size of the element, set background-size to Cover.
  If the image is small but you want to stretch it and force it to fit the size of the element
  the define the background size property and set it to 100% 100%-->

  <!--PICTURE ELEMENT-->
  <!--The picture element is used to display different images on different screen sizes.
  The picture element is important when it comes to bandwidth issues. As in it enebles 
  you display what is commensurate to the screensize being used currently.

  
  It is also important as it enables one to put more than one image format such that if a particular
  browser does not support a certain format of image then the one that is supported is the one 
  that will be displayed.-->
